This is a server part of the assignment.


The server has two data endpoints

1) Current Weather Endpoint: It is used to get current weather data in a particular city. 
User needs to provide 2 request parameters: city name and country code 

Example:
http://localhost:3000/data/weather/current/London/UK


2) Forecast Endpoint: It works pretty much the same as the current weather endpoint

Example:
http://localhost:3000/data/weather/forecast/London/UK
